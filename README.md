# PYTHON_CIPHERS

### SHIFT_CIPHER
- It takes input text and shift amount(number) and replaces each character with the character in the alphabet which is obtained after going forward 'shift' times (adding the shift amount)
- example:
  text: h
  shift: 5
  encrypted text: ASCII(h) + 5 = m
- For decryption it subtracts the shift amount from the character and goes in reverse direction in the alphabet.
- For caesar cipher , substitute shift = 3
